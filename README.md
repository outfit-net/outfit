# OCPHN
This is our Tensorflow implementation for the paper:

## Dataset

The original Polyvore dataset we used in our paper is first proposed [here](https://github.com/xthan/polyvore-dataset). After downloaded the datasets, you can put them in the folder /data/: ;  Original images can also be downloaded , and put them in the folder /data/:.


## Requirements

- Python 3.7
- Tensorflow 1.15.0

## Run the Codes

Then you can run the file `OCPHN/model.py` to train the model.
